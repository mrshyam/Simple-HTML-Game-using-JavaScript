# Discription
Before we can start writing the game's functionality, we need to create a basic structure to render the game inside. This can be done using HTML and the <canvas> element.

# Step 1
* The game's HTML
* Create Canvas

# Step 2
* Defining a drawing loop
* Making it move
* Clearing the canvas before each frame
* Cleaning up our code

# Step 3
* Simple collision detection
* Bouncing off the top and bottom
* Bouncing off the left and right
* The ball keeps disappearing into the wall!

# Step 4
* Defining a paddle to hit the ball
* Allowing the user to control the paddle
* The paddle moving logic

# Step 5
* Implementing game over
* Letting the paddle hit the ball

# Step 6
* Setting up the brick variables
* Brick drawing logic
* Actually drawing the bricks

# Step 7
* A collision detection function
* Making the bricks disappear after they are hit
* Tracking and updating the status in the collision detection function
* Activating our collision detection

# Step 8
* Counting the score
* Displaying a winning message when all bricks have been destroyed

# Step 9
* Listening for mouse movement
* Anchoring the paddle movement to the mouse movement

# Step 10
* Giving the player some lives
* Rendering the lives display
* Improving rendering with requestAnimationFrame()

#* That's all â€” the final version of the game is ready and set to go !
